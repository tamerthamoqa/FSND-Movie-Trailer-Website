# FSND-Movie-Trailer-Website
This is a repository for the Movie Trailer Website project which is the first project required for completing the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program. The project contains python scripts that will generate a website that displays a list of movies and their trailers.

The main purpose of this project is to let students understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented programming using the Python&trade; programming language by doing a project that requires an Object-Oriented solution, like storing movie details in movie objects for displaying them later on a website.

The starter code for this project was forked from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode) by courtesy of Udacity&trade;.

* entertainment_center.py - main Python script to run.
* media.py - Python script that contains class Movie which stores movie information.
* fresh_tomatoes.py - Python script that generates an HTML file that outputs the list of movies and their trailers provided by Udacity&trade;.

# Requirements
Python 2.x or Python 3.x is required to be installed on your computer to be able to run the Python scripts.
